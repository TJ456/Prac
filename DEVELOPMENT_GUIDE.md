# 🚀 TaskFlow Development Guide

## 📚 Prerequisites Knowledge
Before starting, you should understand:
- JavaScript fundamentals (async/await, promises, destructuring)
- Node.js basics (modules, npm, package.json)
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON format and API concepts
- Basic MongoDB/database concepts

## 🛠️ Initial Setup (Do This First!)

### Step 0: Project Foundation
```bash
# Navigate to project folder
cd "c:\Users\Tanmay Joddar\OneDrive\Desktop\Taskflow"

# Install all dependencies
npm install
```
**Why:** Without dependencies, none of your imports will work. This installs Express, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, etc.

### Step 1: Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your actual values
```
**Why:** Your app needs database connection strings and JWT secrets. Do this before writing any database code.

### Step 2: Database Setup
Choose one option:

**Option A: Local MongoDB**
```bash
# Install MongoDB Community Edition
# Start MongoDB service
# Use: mongodb://localhost:27017/taskflow in .env
```

**Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)**
```bash
# Create account at mongodb.com/atlas
# Create cluster and get connection string
# Update MONGO_URI in .env
```
**Why:** Database must be running before you can test your models and connections.

## 📖 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT ORDER (Follow Exactly!)

> **🎯 Learning Philosophy:** We build from the ground up - data layer first, then business logic, then API endpoints, finally the server. Each file depends on the previous ones.

### 🏗️ **PHASE 1: DATA FOUNDATION**
*Build the foundation - what data looks like and how it's stored*

#### **File 1: models/userModel.js** 
**⏰ Write First | 📦 Foundation File**

**Why This File First:**
- Defines what a "user" looks like in our database
- Every other part of the app will reference users
- Must define user structure before creating authentication

**What You're Building:**
- User schema (name, email, password fields)
- Data validation rules
- MongoDB collection structure

**Connections to Other Files:**
- ✅ `controllers/userController.js` imports this to create/find users
- ✅ `models/taskModel.js` will reference this for user relationships
- ✅ `middleware/authMiddleware.js` will use this to verify users exist

**Test After Writing:**
```javascript
// Add this temporarily at bottom of file to test
const User = require('./models/userModel');
console.log(User); // Should show your model
```

---

#### **File 2: models/taskModel.js**
**⏰ Write Second | 🔗 Relationship File**

**Why After userModel.js:**
- Tasks belong to users (one-to-many relationship)
- Need User model to exist first for the relationship reference
- Defines the core data structure for your app's main feature

**What You're Building:**
- Task schema (title, description, status, priority, user reference)
- Relationship to User model
- Task data validation rules

**Connections to Other Files:**
- ✅ Imports User model (that's why User came first)
- ✅ `controllers/taskController.js` will import this for CRUD operations
- ✅ Referenced by task routes for database operations

**Test After Writing:**
```javascript
// Add this temporarily to test relationship
const Task = require('./models/taskModel');
console.log(Task.schema.paths.user); // Should show user reference
```

---

#### **File 3: config/db.js**
**⏰ Write Third | 🔌 Connection File**

**Why After Models:**
- Models define what data looks like
- Database connection is needed to actually store that data
- Connection function will be called by main app

**What You're Building:**
- MongoDB connection function
- Error handling for connection failures
- Environment variable usage

**Connections to Other Files:**
- ✅ `app.js` will import and call this function
- ✅ Once connected, all models can save/retrieve data
- ✅ Must work before testing any database operations

**Test After Writing:**
```javascript
// Test connection
const connectDB = require('./config/db');
connectDB(); // Should connect to your database
```

---

### 🔐 **PHASE 2: AUTHENTICATION FOUNDATION**
*Build security layer - who can access what*

#### **File 4: utils/generateToken.js**
**⏰ Write Fourth | 🎫 Token Factory**

**Why Now:**
- Authentication needs JWT tokens
- This utility will be used by user controller for login/register
- Simple utility function with no dependencies

**What You're Building:**
- Function that creates JWT tokens
- Token expiration configuration
- Secret key usage from environment

**Connections to Other Files:**
- ✅ `controllers/userController.js` will import this to create tokens
- ✅ Called after successful login/registration
- ✅ Tokens will be verified by auth middleware later

**Test After Writing:**
```javascript
// Test token generation
const generateToken = require('./utils/generateToken');
const token = generateToken('testUserId123');
console.log(token); // Should show JWT token string
```

---

#### **File 5: middleware/authMiddleware.js**
**⏰ Write Fifth | 🛡️ Route Guardian**

**Why Now:**
- Need token generator to exist first (to understand token format)
- Need User model to exist (to verify users)
- This middleware will protect routes we create later

**What You're Building:**
- Middleware function that verifies JWT tokens
- User lookup and attachment to request
- Error handling for invalid tokens

**Connections to Other Files:**
- ✅ Imports User model (from File 1)
- ✅ Verifies tokens created by generateToken (from File 4)
- ✅ `routes/taskRoutes.js` will use this to protect endpoints
- ✅ Sets `req.user` for controllers to use

**Test After Writing:**
```javascript
// Test middleware (simplified)
const protect = require('./middleware/authMiddleware');
// Will test properly when routes are set up
```

---

### 🧠 **PHASE 3: BUSINESS LOGIC**
*Build the brains - what the app actually does*

#### **File 6: controllers/userController.js**
**⏰ Write Sixth | 👤 User Manager**

**Why Now:**
- User model exists (from File 1)
- Token generator exists (from File 4)
- Ready to build registration and login logic

**What You're Building:**
- Register function (create users, hash passwords)
- Login function (verify users, return tokens)
- Password security with bcrypt

**Connections to Other Files:**
- ✅ Imports User model (from File 1)
- ✅ Imports generateToken (from File 4)
- ✅ `routes/userRoutes.js` will call these functions
- ✅ Provides authentication for the entire app

**Test After Writing:**
```javascript
// Test functions exist
const { registerUser, loginUser } = require('./controllers/userController');
console.log(typeof registerUser); // Should be 'function'
```

---

#### **File 7: routes/userRoutes.js**
**⏰ Write Seventh | 🛤️ User Endpoints**

**Why Now:**
- User controller exists with register/login functions
- Need to expose these functions as API endpoints
- Authentication routes don't need middleware protection

**What You're Building:**
- POST /register route
- POST /login route
- Route-to-controller mapping

**Connections to Other Files:**
- ✅ Imports userController functions (from File 6)
- ✅ `app.js` will mount these routes
- ✅ Frontend will call these endpoints

**Test After Writing:**
```javascript
// Test routes exist
const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');
console.log(userRoutes); // Should show router object
```

---

#### **File 8: controllers/taskController.js**
**⏰ Write Eighth | 📋 Task Manager**

**Why Now:**
- Task model exists (from File 2)
- Auth middleware exists to protect these operations
- User authentication is working (for user identification)

**What You're Building:**
- Create, Read, Update, Delete functions for tasks
- User-specific task operations
- Proper error handling and authorization

**Connections to Other Files:**
- ✅ Imports Task model (from File 2)
- ✅ Uses `req.user` set by authMiddleware (from File 5)
- ✅ `routes/taskRoutes.js` will call these functions
- ✅ Implements the core app functionality

**Test After Writing:**
```javascript
// Test functions exist
const { getTasks, createTask } = require('./controllers/taskController');
console.log(typeof getTasks); // Should be 'function'
```

---

#### **File 9: routes/taskRoutes.js**
**⏰ Write Ninth | 🛤️ Protected Endpoints**

**Why Now:**
- Task controller exists with CRUD functions
- Auth middleware exists to protect routes
- Need to create protected API endpoints

**What You're Building:**
- Protected CRUD routes for tasks
- Middleware application
- RESTful endpoint design

**Connections to Other Files:**
- ✅ Imports taskController functions (from File 8)
- ✅ Imports authMiddleware (from File 5)
- ✅ `app.js` will mount these routes
- ✅ All routes require authentication

**Test After Writing:**
```javascript
// Test routes exist
const taskRoutes = require('./routes/taskRoutes');
console.log(taskRoutes); // Should show router object
```

---

### 🚀 **PHASE 4: APPLICATION ASSEMBLY**
*Bring everything together into a working server*

#### **File 10: app.js**
**⏰ Write Last | 🏢 Server Orchestrator**

**Why Last:**
- All components exist and ready to be assembled
- Database connection function ready
- All routes ready to be mounted
- All middleware ready to be applied

**What You're Building:**
- Express app configuration
- Middleware setup
- Route mounting
- Server startup

**Connections to ALL Files:**
- ✅ Imports connectDB (from File 3)
- ✅ Imports userRoutes (from File 7)
- ✅ Imports taskRoutes (from File 9)
- ✅ Coordinates entire application

**Test After Writing:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Server should start on http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 🔗 **DEPENDENCY CHAIN VISUALIZATION**

```
📦 package.json (dependencies)
    ↓
🔧 .env (configuration)
    ↓
👤 userModel.js (defines users)
    ↓
📋 taskModel.js (defines tasks, references users)
    ↓
🔌 db.js (connects to database)
    ↓
🎫 generateToken.js (creates JWT tokens)
    ↓
🛡️ authMiddleware.js (uses User model + JWT verification)
    ↓
👤 userController.js (uses User model + generateToken)
    ↓
🛤️ userRoutes.js (uses userController)
    ↓
📋 taskController.js (uses Task model + authMiddleware data)
    ↓
🛤️ taskRoutes.js (uses taskController + authMiddleware)
    ↓
🏢 app.js (assembles everything)
```

## ✅ **TESTING CHECKPOINTS**

After each file, test that it works before moving to the next:

1. **After Models:** Can create schema objects
2. **After DB Config:** Can connect to database
3. **After Token Generator:** Can create JWT tokens
4. **After Auth Middleware:** Can verify tokens
5. **After User Controller:** Can register/login users
6. **After User Routes:** Can test auth endpoints with Postman
7. **After Task Controller:** Functions exist and import correctly
8. **After Task Routes:** Routes are properly configured
9. **After App.js:** Full server runs and accepts requests

## 🎯 **WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS**

**Bottom-Up Architecture:**
- Foundation first (data models)
- Security layer second (authentication)
- Business logic third (controllers)
- API layer fourth (routes)
- Assembly last (main app)

**Dependency Management:**
- Each file only imports files created before it
- No circular dependencies
- Easy to debug and test incrementally

**Learning Progression:**
- Simple concepts first (schemas)
- Complex concepts last (full application assembly)
- Each step builds on previous knowledge
